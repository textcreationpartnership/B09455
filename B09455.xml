            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LOYAL PAPER OF VERSES, UPON HIS MAJESTIES GRACIOUS DECLARATION.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>INgenious Poets! can your Pens lye still</l>
               <l>On such a Subject, as might Volumes fill:</l>
               <l>Hark! how the Declaration sounds our Joys,</l>
               <l>None but great <hi>JAMES</hi> could chime such Heavenly Noise.</l>
               <l>Envy, Rebellion, or some Self-interest,</l>
               <l>Not true Religion, lodgeth in the Breast;</l>
               <l>Divided now from our dread Sovereign,</l>
               <l>Ever once to disturb his Peaceful Reign.</l>
               <l>Rejoyce all <hi>England,</hi> that the Heavens did bring</l>
               <l>Bless'd <hi>JAMES,</hi> the Wise, to be our Gracious King.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:188011:2"/>
               <l> You need not of His Gracious Mercy doubt,</l>
               <l>Nor send Petitions when it comes without.</l>
               <l>What wou'd you have? You now can ask no more,</l>
               <l>Here's Mercy strew'd at every Subjects Door.</l>
               <l>You have free Liberty, not lead, nor driven,</l>
               <l>May take the farest, safest way to Heaven.</l>
               <l>My Pen is too Inferiour, I confess,</l>
               <l>To circulate this Wisdom; the Excess</l>
               <l>Cannot be bounded by Illiterate Lines;</l>
               <l>But ought to be enlarg'd by Divines.</l>
               <l>However, what I here have boldly Pen'd,</l>
               <l>My Sword shall be as ready to Defend.</l>
               <l>If any Controversie should arise,</l>
               <l>Against a Prince so Merciful and Wise,</l>
               <l>Although the Protestant Religion I</l>
               <l>Profess, and hope I shall do, till I Die;</l>
               <l>I wish Great <hi>JAMES</hi> a Long and Glorious Reign.</l>
               <l>And he that will not all His Rights maintain:</l>
               <l>But basely would Exclude the Lawful Heir,</l>
               <l>Let him of all His Mercies have no share.</l>
               <l>He that lets every Man enjoy his Own,</l>
               <l>Why should not he, Religion, Life and Crown?</l>
               <l>Then let us Pay our King His just reward,</l>
               <l>And every Subject be to him a Guard.</l>
               <l>All Men, that are Religious, do approve,</l>
               <l>That 'tis Commanded to unite in Love.</l>
               <l>There's no Religion, neither mine nor yours,</l>
               <l>But must be subject to the higher Powers.</l>
               <l>And he that hath done all Religions right,</l>
               <l>You cannot less then with your Love requite.</l>
               <l>Let Loyalty then Florish every where,</l>
               <l>Having more reason now to Love than Fear.</l>
               <l>And may the King with Glory now be Crown'd,</l>
               <l>His Royal Queen likewise with fame renown'd;</l>
               <l>And every Subject to the highest degree,</l>
               <l>Be true to Him, and all the Progeny.</l>
